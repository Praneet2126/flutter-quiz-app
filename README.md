A new Flutter project. This app consists of a set of 6 questions related to Flutter framework. Do check it out on your iOS or Android devices. 

## How to run?

- First, fork the project.
- Clone the project into your system. (Visual Studio Code recommended)
- Have an emulator up running. You would need Android Studio installed for it.
